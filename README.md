## Roadmap

- [x] Add support for admins (only room admin can reveal/reset votes) - show who the admin is (I think we'll set the admin id when creating the room)
- [ ] Improve UI (style voting cards as playing cards, randomize suit for fun)
- [x] Improve User list styles (show who voted, who hasn't voted, etc)
- [ ] Add support throwing emojis at people
