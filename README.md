## Roadmap

- [x] Add support for admins (only room admin can reveal/reset votes) - show who the admin is (I think we'll set the admin id when creating the room)
- [x] Improve UI
- [x] fix: refreshing renames Player 1, 2, etc. (to highest numbered player)
- [x] Improve User list styles (show who voted, who hasn't voted, etc)
- [ ] Style voting cards as playing cards, randomize suit for fun
- [ ] Add support throwing emojis at people
- [ ] Show voting stats (eg. average, most common, etc.)
- [ ] Refactor to svelte (or at least optimize build)
